# Ludo Online

[Ludo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo) is a popular game originated from the indian game [Pachisi](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachisi).

I made this project to expand my portfolio and to practice `React` in combination with a `real time connection` to the backend and `css animations`.

This repo is linked to `Vercel`, available for playing, and I will keep updating and solving bugs whenever I have the time to.

## Goal

**The player who places all their pawns on the final square (triangle) wins the game.**

## Rules
- It is a turn based game
- The first player to roll the dice is the first player to enter the room, the second player to enter will play next and so on
- You can move the pawns in the common road (white squares) with any roll result
- To move a pawn from the initial zone you need to roll 1 or 6
- If you roll 6, you gain an extra turn. Up to three times
- If your pawn stops in the same square as the enemy pawn, it will be smashed and get back to the initial zone
- The squares with a Great Shield or a Stone Door are safe, no pawn can be smashed there
- If two pawns of the same color get together in the same square, they join forces and grow, the enemies can be in the same square but can not smash them
- If for some reason, like the rule above, two pawns of different colors stay in the same square and a third one of another color gets in, there ain't no smashing too
- Basically you can only smash a pawn if it is alone in a common white square
- Once a pawn reaches the hidden door of it's color, it can enter the Final Road (the middle squares)
- To get to the final square (triangle) you need an exact result, if a pawn is in the last square before the triangle, you need to roll 1. If there are 4 squares of distance, you can enter the final triangle with a 4, but you can move closer with a 3, 2 or 1
- Once the winner is decided, the game continues to decide the second and third place
- The winner gets to see fireworks in the ending screen ðŸŽ‡

## Worth to Mention

When I was digging into Ludo's rules I found many disagreements between players, writen rules and another online games. So in the end, I just used the rules I found the most fun.

***Developer Note:***
```
The rule that allows you to put 12 pawns in the same square was really a challenge accepted for me (I am not that good in CSS).
The solution I came up was to increase the pawn size when two or more of the same color get together, therefore, instead of 12 minor pawns I could just delegate this logic to the backend and put a maximum of 4 greater pawns in the same square. Their sizes can increase and decrease based on how many pawns are grouped together.

## Known Issues

- On **smartphones** and **tablets** pawns can be a bit out of place
- On **smartphones** and **tablets** the animations are not as clean
- On **smartphones** and **tablets** the `z-index` is not being fully respected by the browser, causing the head of the pawns to disappear from time to time and the body to appear in front of anything
