# Ludo Online

[Ludo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo) is a popular game originated from the indian game [Pachisi](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachisi).

I made this project to expand my portfolio and to practice `React` in combination with a `real time connection` to the backend and `css animations`.

This repo is linked to `Vercel`, available for playing, and I will keep updating and solving bugs whenever I have the time to.
